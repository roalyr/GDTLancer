# GDTLancer Development Plan - Phase 1 Implementation

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** December 19, 2025  
**Status:** Active Development — Sprint 11 Next  
**Scope:** Phase 1 - "The First Contract" Demo + World Persistence Foundation

---

## 0. Guiding Principles

1. **GDD is frozen** - No design changes, only implementation of existing specifications
2. **Code robustness first** - Every feature must be testable and have clear failure states
3. **Incremental delivery** - Each sprint produces a playable, testable build
4. **Placeholder-driven** - Use primitives for assets/UI, replace with art later
5. **Test early, test often** - Manual test checklists after each sprint

---

## 1. Current State Assessment

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED & WORKING (Sprints 1-10 Complete)
- **Autoloads:** Constants, EventBus, GlobalRefs, GameState, CoreMechanicsAPI, TemplateDatabase, GameStateManager
- **Core Systems:** TimeSystem, CharacterSystem, AssetSystem, InventorySystem, TradingSystem, ContractSystem, CombatSystem, NarrativeActionSystem, EventSystem (all stateless, API-based)
- **Agent Architecture:** KinematicBody agents with MovementSystem + NavigationSystem + WeaponController components

- **Global Agent Persistency (Sprint 12):** Persistent NPC population, patrol behavior, HUD markers, full serialization

---

## 2. Sprint Structure

Each sprint is **1-2 weeks** and follows this pattern:
1. **Implement** - Write code, create placeholders
2. **Unit Test** - Write/run GUT tests for new systems
3. **Integration Test** - Manual testing checklist
4. **Polish** - Bug fixes only, no scope expansion

---

## 3. Sprint Schedule

### SPRINT 1: Foundation Fixes (Critical Path) ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Wire existing systems together properly before adding new features.

#### 1.1 Ship Stats Integration
**Problem:** Agent movement uses hardcoded values instead of ShipTemplate stats.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Modify `agent.gd` `initialize()` to pull `move_params` from the agent's linked `ShipTemplate`
- [x] Add a helper in `AssetSystem` to get ship by character UID: `get_ship_for_character(char_uid)`
- [x] Ensure `WorldGenerator` correctly links character → ship UID
- [x] Update `AgentSystem.spawn_player()` to pass `character_uid` in overrides

**Files modified:**
- `core/agents/agent.gd` - Added `character_uid`, `_get_movement_params_from_ship()`
- `core/systems/asset_system.gd` - Added `get_ship_for_character()`, `get_ships_for_character()`
- `core/systems/agent_system.gd` - Added `character_uid` to spawn overrides, added `spawn_npc()`

**Test Checklist (Sprint 1.1):**
- [ ] Spawn player agent → verify movement speed matches `ship_default.tres` values (300.0)
- [ ] Change `ship_default.tres` max_speed → verify in-game speed changes
- [ ] Spawn NPC with different ship template → verify different handling

---

#### 1.2 EventBus Signal Audit
**Problem:** Some signals declared but unused; some missing for new features.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Audit all EventBus signals - document which are connected
- [x] Add missing signals for Phase 1:
  - `game_state_loaded` - After GameStateManager restores state
  - `combat_initiated`, `combat_ended` - Combat lifecycle
  - `agent_damaged`, `agent_disabled` - Combat damage events
  - `contract_accepted`, `contract_completed`, `contract_abandoned`, `contract_failed` - Contract lifecycle
  - `trade_transaction_completed` - Trading events
  - `dock_available`, `dock_unavailable`, `player_docked`, `player_undocked` - Docking events
  - `narrative_action_requested`, `narrative_action_resolved` - Narrative action events

**Files modified:**
- `autoload/EventBus.gd` - Added all new signals

---

#### 1.3 GameState Extensions
**Problem:** GameState lacks containers for contracts, locations, narrative state.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Add to `GameState.gd`:
  - `locations: Dictionary` - Zone/station data
  - `contracts: Dictionary` - Available contracts
  - `active_contracts: Dictionary` - Player's accepted contracts  
  - `narrative_state: Dictionary` - Reputation, faction standings
  - `session_stats: Dictionary` - Session tracking

**Files modified:**
- `autoload/GameState.gd`

**Test Checklist (Sprint 1.2-1.3):**
- [ ] Print EventBus signal list → verify all new signals exist
- [ ] Print GameState.contracts → verify empty dict exists
- [ ] Save/Load game → verify new fields persist (may need GameStateManager update)

  - `_on_sell_pressed()`: Call `TradingSystem.execute_sell()`, refresh displays
  - Update WP and cargo displays after each transaction
  - Handle errors (show message if transaction fails)

**Test Checklist (Sprint 5):**
- [ ] Open trade screen → station inventory displays correctly
- [ ] Open trade screen → player cargo displays correctly
- [ ] Buy 1 commodity → WP decreases, cargo increases, lists update
- [ ] Sell 1 commodity → WP increases, cargo decreases, lists update

  - [Return to Menu] button
- [x] "Soft lose": WP drops below 0
  - For Phase 1: Just show warning, allow continued play
  - (Full game would have debt mechanics)
- [x] No explicit "win" for Phase 1 (sandbox demo)

**Test Checklist (Sprint 10):**
- [ ] New Game → player spawns docked at station
- [ ] Complete full contract cycle (accept → travel → deliver)
- [ ] WP updates correctly through full cycle
- [ ] Combat encounter during travel → survive → continue to destination
- [ ] Combat encounter → die → game over screen → return to menu
- [ ] Time Clock fills → upkeep deducted
- [ ] Upkeep with insufficient WP → warning displayed
- [ ] Multiple contract completions → verify stacking rewards

### SPRINT 11: Ship Quirks System 🎯 CURRENT
**Goal:** Complete final Phase 1 Definition of Done item: "Ship quirks can be gained from failures."

> **See IMMEDIATE-TODO.md for detailed task breakdown**

#### 11.1 Quirk Template & Registry
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `QuirkTemplate` resource class (`database/definitions/quirk_template.gd`)
- [ ] Create Phase 1 quirk instances: scratched_hull, jammed_landing_gear, damaged_radiator, reputation_tarnished
- [ ] Add quirk templates to TemplateDatabase loading

#### 11.2 Quirk System API
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `QuirkSystem` (`src/core/systems/quirk_system.gd`) with stateless API
- [ ] API: `add_quirk_to_ship()`, `remove_quirk_from_ship()`, `get_quirks_for_ship()`
- [ ] API: `get_total_modifier()`, `repair_quirk()`
- [ ] Add EventBus signals: `quirk_added`, `quirk_removed`

#### 11.3 Integration
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update NarrativeActionSystem to use QuirkSystem API
- [ ] Add quirk triggers to CombatSystem on hull damage thresholds
- [ ] Add quirk display to Main HUD

#### 11.4 Testing
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write GUT unit tests for QuirkSystem
- [ ] Manual playtest checklist

**Test Checklist (Sprint 11):**
- [ ] Risky dock_arrival failure → quirk added to ship, displayed on HUD
- [ ] Heavy combat damage → quirk trigger chance
- [ ] Quirk modifier affects narrative action rolls
- [ ] Repair quirk at station → WP deducted, quirk removed
- [ ] Save/Load preserves ship quirks

---

### SPRINT 12: Global Agent Persistency 📋 PLANNED
**Goal:** Foundation for "Living World" — persistent NPC population.

> **See IMMEDIATE-TODO.md for detailed task breakdown**

#### 12.1 World Population System
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `GameState.world_agents` dictionary for persistent NPC state
- [ ] Create `WorldPopulationSystem` to manage ~100 NPCs across 300,000 unit zone
- [ ] Generate anchor points for NPC patrol orbits

#### 12.2 NPC Behavior
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `STATE_PATROL` to AI controller (orbit anchor point)
- [ ] Hostile response when attacked, return to anchor when target lost
- [ ] Sync agent state to GameState.world_agents periodically

#### 12.3 HUD Indicators
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `AgentMarkerOverlay` showing all NPC positions
- [ ] Faint X bracket markers, color-coded by state (neutral/hostile/disabled)

#### 12.4 Serialization
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Full agent state serialization: position, rotation, hull, cargo, quirks
- [ ] Disabled agents persist (not despawned)

**Test Checklist (Sprint 12):**
- [ ] New Game spawns ~100 NPCs distributed across zone
- [ ] NPCs orbit anchor points, don't attack unprovoked
- [ ] Attack NPC → becomes hostile, pursues, returns to patrol when disengaged
- [ ] HUD shows faint markers for all agents
- [ ] Save/Load preserves all agent states exactly

---

### SPRINT 13: Polish & Edge Cases 📋 PLANNED
**Goal:** Stability, edge case handling, performance validation.

#### 13.1 Save/Load Verification
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Verify all new data serializes: quirks, world_agents, anchor states
- [ ] Test save during various states (mid-flight, docked, combat, etc.)
- [ ] Test load restores exact state

#### 13.2 Error Handling
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add null checks to all system API functions
- [ ] Add fallback behaviors for missing templates
- [ ] Ensure no orphan nodes

#### 13.3 Performance Check
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Profile with 100 NPC agents in zone
- [ ] Check for memory leaks after extended play
- [ ] Verify no physics errors in console

**Test Checklist (Sprint 13):**
- [ ] Play for 15 minutes continuously → no crashes
- [ ] Save mid-mission → load → continue exactly where left off
- [ ] Trigger every error condition intentionally → graceful handling
- [ ] Complete 5 contracts in one session → stable performance

## 4. Asset Placeholder List

These primitives should be replaced with final art after Phase 1 gameplay is solid:

| Placeholder | Location | Replace With |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Player ship mesh | `assets/models/ships/` | Detailed ship model |
| Enemy ship mesh | `assets/models/ships/` | Hostile ship model |
| Station mesh | `scenes/zones/objects/` | Station model |
| Weapon fire effect | (none currently) | Laser/projectile VFX |
| Explosion effect | (none currently) | Destruction VFX |
| UI panel backgrounds | `core/ui/*/` | Themed panel textures |
| Commodity icons | (none currently) | Item icon sprites |
| Character portraits | (none currently) | Portrait images |

---

## 5. Testing Protocol

After each sprint, perform this testing sequence:

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Run from Godot editor or command line
godot --path . -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gdir=res://tests/ -gexit
```

### Manual Test Sessions
1. **Fresh Start Test:** New game, play for 5 minutes, verify core loop
2. **Persistence Test:** Save, quit, load, verify state
3. **Stress Test:** Rapid actions, edge cases, try to break it
4. **Flow Test:** Complete intended player journey start-to-finish

### Bug Tracking
- Log issues in a simple text file: `KNOWN-ISSUES.md`
- Format: `[Sprint X] [System] Brief description - Status`
- Prioritize: Blocker > Major > Minor > Polish

---

## 6. Definition of Done - Phase 1

Phase 1 is complete when:

- [x] Player can start new game and spawn at station
- [x] Player can view and accept contracts
- [x] Player can buy/sell commodities at stations
- [x] Player can fly between two stations
- [x] Player can complete delivery contracts and receive rewards
- [x] Combat encounters can trigger during flight
- [x] Player can fight and disable enemy ships
- [x] Narrative Actions resolve with visible outcomes
- [x] Time system triggers upkeep costs
- [ ] **Ship quirks can be gained from failures** ← Sprint 11
- [x] Game state can be saved and loaded
- [ ] No critical bugs or crashes during 15-minute play session
- [ ] All unit tests pass (target: 190+)

### Phase 1+ (World Persistence Foundation)

After Sprint 12, additional criteria:

- [ ] World contains persistent NPC population (~100 agents)
- [ ] NPCs patrol/orbit anchor points when neutral
- [ ] NPCs become hostile when attacked, return to patrol when disengaged
- [ ] All NPC positions visible on HUD as markers
- [ ] Full agent state serializes in save files
- [ ] Disabled agents persist (not despawned)

---

## 7. Post-Phase 1

After Phase 1 is validated and stable:

1. **Art Pass:** Replace all placeholders with final assets
2. **Audio Pass:** Add sound effects and music
3. **Balance Pass:** Tune WP rewards, prices, upkeep costs, combat damage
4. **UX Pass:** Improve UI flow, add tooltips, polish animations
5. **Content Pass:** Add more contracts, locations, ship types

Then proceed to Phase 2 (Mining/Industrial module, deeper narrative systems).
