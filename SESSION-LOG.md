| Timestamp | Agent | Action | Result | Note for Future Agents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_15: Cleanup and Verify | SUCCESS | Deleted 14 dead system/definition .gd files (action_system, combat_system, trading_system, narrative_action_system, contract_system, quirk_system, progression_system, traffic_system, world_map_system, goal_system, chronicle_system, NarrativeOutcomes, contact_template, quirk_template). Deleted 8 dead UI/DB directories (action_check, inventory_screen, narrative_status, contacts_panel, character_status, station_menu src+scenes, registry/contacts, registry/quirks).

| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_14: Create Unit Tests for Simulation Engine | SUCCESS | Created 6 test files in src/tests/core/simulation/: test_ca_rules.gd (7 tests: influence propagation, pirate growth, extraction, diffusion, market pricing, wreck degradation, matter return, purity assertion), test_world_layer.gd (5 tests: init, total matter, determinism, seed stored, bidirectional connections), test_grid_layer.gd (4 tests: init, extraction depletes, stockpile increases, price reacts), test_agent_layer.gd (5 tests: agents initialized, NPC goal evaluation, repair priority, respawn, knowledge snapshot), test_chronicle_layer.gd (4 tests: event logged, rumor generated, event distributed, empty no-op), test_simulation_tick.gd (4 tests: full tick sequence, matter conservation axiom over 5 ticks, deterministic simulation, tick count increments). All GUT framework pattern: extends GutTest, before_each/after_each with full GameState reset. 0 errors across all 6 files. |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_13: Prune Dead Systems and Signals | SUCCESS | EventBus: removed 9 dead signals (contract_accepted/completed/abandoned/failed, narrative_action_requested/resolved, ship_quirk_added/removed, trade_transaction_completed), added 2 new simulation signals (sim_tick_completed, sim_initialized). GlobalRefs: removed 10 dead system vars+setters (action_system, trading_system, contract_system, narrative_action_system, combat_system, quirk_system, progression_system, traffic_system, world_map_system, goal_system). main_game_scene.tscn: removed 10 dead system nodes+ext_resources, added SimulationEngine node (id=26). Wired sim_initialized and sim_tick_completed emission into simulation_engine.gd. |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_12: Create Sim Debug Panel | SUCCESS | Created sim_debug_panel.gd (~260 lines, extends CanvasLayer) + sim_debug_panel.tscn. Toggle with F3. Reads all 4 GameState layers and renders BBCode text: World (topology/hazards/resources per sector), Grid (stockpiles/prices/dominion/power/entropy + wrecks), Agents (name/sector/hull/cash/goal/disabled + hostile population), Chronicle (last 10 events + last 5 rumors), Axiom 1 check (expected vs actual matter with PASS/FAIL). Wired into main_game_scene.tscn as sibling node. Refreshes on world_event_tick_triggered signal. |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_11: Extend LocationTemplate (auto-complete) | SUCCESS | Already completed in TASK_3 (prior session). LocationTemplate has 9 World Layer exports, 3 .tres files updated. Checkbox marked. |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_10: Add Simulation Constants | SUCCESS | Added 25 simulation constants to Constants.gd in new SIMULATION ENGINE section (CA params, wreck/entropy, agent, heat, power, bridge drains, decision thresholds, Axiom 1 tolerance). Rewired simulation_engine.gd _build_tick_config() — all 25 hardcoded values now reference Constants.X. Zero magic numbers remain in tick config. |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_9: Rewire TimeSystem to Drive SimulationEngine | SUCCESS | Rewrote time_system.gd as pure clock (55 lines). Removed character_system.apply_upkeep_cost() call (moved to bridge_systems entropy). Renamed _trigger_world_event_tick → _emit_world_tick. TimeSystem now only accumulates time + emits world_event_tick_triggered. SimulationEngine handles all tick orchestration. |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_8: Create Simulation Engine — Tick Orchestrator | SUCCESS | Created simulation_engine.gd (~280 lines, extends Node). _ready() instantiates all 6 layer processors as References, injects ca_rules into grid_layer, registers in GlobalRefs, connects to EventBus.world_event_tick_triggered. initialize_simulation(seed) chains world→grid→agent init + recalculates Axiom 1 checksum. process_tick() runs 5-step sequence + verify_matter_conservation() with detailed breakdown on drift. _build_tick_config() centralizes all tuning params. Added simulation_engine var + setter to GlobalRefs.gd. |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_7: Create Chronicle Layer Processor | SUCCESS | Created chronicle_layer.gd (~250 lines). log_event() stages event packets. process_tick() implements steps 5a–5e: collect from staging buffer (ring buffer capped at 200), tag causality (stub), significance scores (stub 0.5), rumor engine (templated past-tense text with actor/location name resolution), distribute to nearby agents' event_memory (same + connected sectors, capped at 20). Humanize helpers for action IDs, snake_case IDs, actor/location name lookup via GameState.characters and TemplateDatabase. |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_6: Create Bridge Systems Processor | SUCCESS | Created bridge_systems.gd (~150 lines). process_tick() implements steps 3a–3c: Heat Sink (binary overheating from activity vs thermal_background_k dissipation), Entropy System (hull degradation from local_entropy_rate + propellant/energy drain when undocked), Knowledge Refresh (current sector = perfect knowledge, timestamps for staleness tracking, noise stub for future decay). |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_5: Create Agent Layer Processor | SUCCESS | Created agent_layer.gd (~370 lines). initialize_agents() seeds player + 5 persistent NPCs from AgentTemplate/CharacterTemplate .tres files with full state dict (knowledge snapshots, goal queues, faction standings). process_tick() implements steps 4a–4c: goal evaluation (repair>trade>idle heuristic), action execution (buy/sell/move abstract state changes, matter-conserving trades), respawn logic (tick-based timeout → home sector), hostile population integral (logistic growth toward piracy-derived carrying capacity). |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_4: Create Grid Layer Processor | SUCCESS | Created grid_layer.gd (~310 lines). initialize_grid() seeds 6 grid sub-dicts from templates (stockpiles from market_inventory, dominion from controlling_faction_id, market/power/maintenance/resource_availability). process_tick() implements GDD steps 2a–2g with double-buffering and Axiom 1 assertion. Wreck processing groups by sector, returns matter to mineral_density. |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_3: Create World Layer Initializer | SUCCESS | Extended LocationTemplate with 9 World Layer exports. Updated 3 .tres files with sector topology (triangle graph), hazards, resources. Created world_layer.gd (170 lines) — initializes GameState Layer 1 from TemplateDatabase, calculates Axiom 1 matter checksum, provides get_neighbors/get_hazards/get_resource_potential/recalculate_total_matter utilities. |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_2: Create CA Rules Module | SUCCESS | Created ca_rules.gd (320 lines) — 7 pure CA transition functions + 2 helpers. All stateless, config-driven, zero GameState coupling. |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Senior | TASK_1: Gut GameState — Rebuild as Four-Layer Data Store | SUCCESS | Rebuilt GameState.gd (165 lines) with 4-layer model. Fixed 4 KEPT systems (time_system, inventory_system, world_generator, GameStateManager). Legacy alias for persistent_agents. |

| 2026-02-13 | L2-Builder | TASK_1: Gut GameState — Rebuild as Four-Layer Data Store | SUCCESS | Restructured GameState.gd into 4 simulation layers (World/Grid/Agents/Chronicle) + sim meta + scene state + legacy compat. Removed: active_actions, assets_modules, contacts, persistent_agents→legacy alias, contracts, active_contracts, narrative_state, session_stats. Fixed kept systems: time_system.gd (removed session_stats ref), inventory_system.gd (removed assets_modules lookup), world_generator.gd (removed _load_contracts, _load_contacts, narrative_state.faction_standings seed, _create_module_instance). Rebuilt GameStateManager.gd serialization for new 4-layer schema. All 5 modified files: 0 lint errors. |
| 2026-02-13 | L2-Builder | TASK_2: Create CA Rules Module — Pure Functions | SUCCESS | Created src/core/simulation/ca_rules.gd (extends Reference, ~320 lines). 7 pure functions: strategic_map_step (faction influence propagation, security/piracy dynamics), supply_demand_step (extraction + diffusion with matter conservation), market_pressure_step (price deltas from supply/demand curve), entropy_step (wreck degradation + matter return), influence_network_step (agent reputation propagation), power_load_step (station power ratio), maintenance_pressure_step (entropy rate from hazards). All functions take config Dict for tuning — zero coupling to autoloads. 0 lint errors. |
| 2026-02-13 | L1-Architect | Python Sandbox Restructuring — Package Hierarchy | SUCCESS | Restructured python_sandbox from 12 flat .py files into Godot-mirroring package hierarchy: autoload/ (constants.py, game_state.py), core/simulation/ (ca_rules.py, bridge_systems.py, chronicle_layer.py, world_layer.py, grid_layer.py, agent_layer.py, simulation_engine.py), database/registry/ (template_data.py), tests/ (test_ca_rules.py). Created 6 __init__.py package markers. Updated main.py import path. Deleted all 11 old flat files. All imports use package-qualified paths. |
| 2026-02-13 | L1-Architect | Python Sandbox — commodity_specie + Specie Injection | SUCCESS | Added commodity_specie as 11th commodity in COMMODITY_IDS. Added constants: STATION_INITIAL_SPECIE=200.0, SPECIE_SOURCE="hidden_resources", WRECK_SLAG_FRACTION=0.3. Implemented Specie injection in grid_layer.py _seed_stockpiles(): each station receives 200.0 specie debited from hidden_resources (mineral_density first, propellant_sources fallback). Added commodity_specie market data (buy/sell price=1, quantity=200) to all 5 stations in template_data.py. Added slag_total, undiscovered_matter_pool, universe_constant tracking to game_state.py. Axiom 1: TOTAL_MATTER + UNDISCOVERED_MATTER_POOL + slag_total == UNIVERSE_CONSTANT. |
| 2026-02-13 | L1-Architect | Python Sandbox — Verification | SUCCESS | `python3 main.py --ticks 10 --quiet`: PASSED. Axiom 1 max drift 0.1106% (90.00 units / 81388.18 budget — within tolerance). All 14 agents operational. STOCKPILE_COMMODITIES shows spec (commodity_specie) column across all 6 sectors. Explorer discovered sector_discovered_6 at tick 2. Chronicle shows Specie hauling activity. `python3 -m unittest tests.test_ca_rules -v`: 58/58 tests PASSED in 0.005s. Note: pytest not installed on system; use `python3 -m unittest` instead. Note: 0.1106% Axiom 1 drift is pre-existing (agent cash_reserves/wages outside matter tracking), not introduced by this refactor. |
| 2026-02-21 | L1-Architect | Tag-Affinity System — Design & Planning | SUCCESS | Analyzed Concept_injection.md against existing python_sandbox architecture. Designed 11-step integration plan: inject tag-affinity as decision layer (not replace CA/grid/chronicle), derive tags from personality_traits, simple mechanical resolution (score→action type→handler), tag all entities (agents AND sectors), hardcoded affinity dict, skip Axiom 1 conservation for prototyping. |
| 2026-02-21 | L2-Senior | Created affinity_matrix.py | SUCCESS | New file: python_sandbox/core/simulation/affinity_matrix.py (~370 lines). Contains: AFFINITY_MATRIX (~50 tag pairs), ATTACK/TRADE/FLEE thresholds, TAG_TRAIT_RULES (5 personality→tag rules), ROLE_TAGS (7 roles), DYNAMIC_AGENT_RULES (6 runtime rules), SECTOR_TAG_RULES (12 sector property→tag rules). Functions: compute_affinity(), derive_agent_tags(), derive_sector_tags(). |
| 2026-02-21 | L2-Senior | Modified bridge_systems.py — Tag Refresh | SUCCESS | Added _refresh_agent_tags() and _refresh_sector_tags() called every tick in process_tick(). Agent tags derived from personality_traits + role + runtime state → written to agent["sentiment_tags"]. Sector tags derived from dominion/stockpiles/hazards/topology → written to state.grid_sector_tags. |
| 2026-02-21 | L2-Senior | Modified game_state.py — Sector Tags | SUCCESS | Added grid_sector_tags: dict = {} to Layer 2 section. |
| 2026-02-21 | L2-Senior | Modified constants.py — Affinity Params | SUCCESS | Added 10 AFFINITY_* constants (ATTACK_DAMAGE_FACTOR, LOOT_FRACTION, TRADE_SELL/BUY_AMOUNT, REPAIR_AMOUNT, HARVEST_RATE, SECURITY_BOOST, PIRACY_SUPPRESS, PIRACY_BOOST, WAGE_PER_TICK). Relaxed AXIOM1_RELATIVE_TOLERANCE from 1.5% to 50% for prototyping. |
| 2026-02-21 | L2-Senior | Rewrote agent_layer.py — Affinity-Driven Dispatch | SUCCESS | Replaced role-based _evaluate_goals with affinity-driven: checks DESPERATE tag for survival override, otherwise sets goal to "affinity_scan". Replaced _execute_action with unified dispatch to "flee_to_safety" or "affinity_scan". Added 10 new methods: _action_flee_to_safety, _action_affinity_scan, _resolve_agent_interaction, _resolve_sector_interaction, _try_dock, _action_harvest, _apply_sector_effects, _transfer_cargo, _bilateral_trade, _try_exploration. Score thresholds: ATTACK≥1.5, TRADE≥0.5, FLEE≤-1.0. Removed 16 old dead role-specific handlers (_action_prospect, _action_patrol, _action_haul, _action_pirate, _action_explore + helpers). Kept _action_buy, _action_sell, _discover_new_sector. |
| 2026-02-21 | L2-Senior | Modified simulation_engine.py — Axiom 1 Softened | SUCCESS | Changed Axiom 1 violation from hard error to warning-only print. |
| 2026-02-21 | L2-Senior | Modified chronicle_layer.py — New Action Types | SUCCESS | Added 11 affinity action types to _humanize_action() map: attack, agent_trade, flee, flee_to_safety, harvest, affinity_scan, sector_effects, exploration, sector_discovered, expedition_failed. |
| 2026-02-21 | L2-Senior | Modified main.py — Tag Reporting | SUCCESS | Added "tags" field (truncated to 30 chars) to _snapshot_agents() output. |
| 2026-02-21 | L2-Senior | Created test_affinity.py | SUCCESS | New file: python_sandbox/tests/test_affinity.py (9 tests). Tests: compute_affinity positive/negative/empty/symmetric pairs, threshold reachability, derive_agent_tags basic + desperate, derive_sector_tags with FakeState, threshold ordering. All 9/9 passing. |
| 2026-02-21 | L2-Senior | Verification — 50-tick Simulation Run | SUCCESS | `python3 main.py --ticks 50`: No crashes, 0% Axiom 1 drift. All 14 agents running under affinity_scan goal. Emergent behaviors observed: Pirates (Crow, Vex) accumulating cash + cargo at Alpha (richest sector). Military (Nyx, Siv) migrated to Gamma (highest early piracy), suppressed piracy to 0. Vera attacked by pirates at t=8 (hull→0), respawned at t=15 with debt. Haulers (Kai, Rex) buying/selling at stations. Chronicle generating humanized rumors. Stockpiles growing steadily. |
| 2026-02-21 | L2-Senior | Marked Concept_injection.md as Implemented | SUCCESS | Added STATUS: IMPLEMENTED header to Concept_injection.md. File kept as design reference. |
