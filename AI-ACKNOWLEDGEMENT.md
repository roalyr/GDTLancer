## Acknowledgement of AI Assistance

This project utilizes generative AI technologies as a tool to enhance developer productivity during its development. The core functionality, architecture, and final decisions remain the product of human engineering and review.

**Scope of AI Use:**

* **Code Generation and Refinement:** AI assistance was used to generate, refactor, and optimize code snippets.
* **Documentation:** AI tools assisted in drafting, structuring, summarizing, and refining project documentation (such as README files, guides, code comments, and API documentation). While AI provided initial drafts or suggestions, the final documentation content has been reviewed and edited by the development team for accuracy and clarity.
* **Exclusion of Embedded Assets:** No AI-generated creative assets (e.g., images, audio, user-interface text intended for direct display *within* the application) are incorporated into the production version of this software.
* **Repository Artefacts:** Any other AI-generated assets potentially present in the repository were either:
    * Used as temporary placeholders during development and have since been removed or replaced, or
    * Created prior to the formalization of this acknowledgement and are not intended for production use or distribution.
* **Models and Data:** All AI models used were either publicly available or trained exclusively on permissively licensed data.

**Human Oversight:**

All AI-generated contributions, whether code or documentation, are subject to human review, modification, and approval before being integrated into the project. The ultimate responsibility for the software and its documentation lies with the human development team.

**Licensing:**

This project is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

**Note:** The use of the GPLv3 license predates the integration of AI development tools into this project's workflow.
